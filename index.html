Number       Action                  Sound
1                  Shake                   Bubble
2                  Rotate                   Engine
3                  Rotate, Click        Laser                

1. When shaking the phone, it triggers a bubble sound. It sounds almost like a pingpong ball, so this action and triggered sound could simulate hitting a pingpong ball with a racquet. It sounds like two people are playing a pingpong match.

2. When rotating the phone downwards, an engine sound is triggered. It could be a simulation of turning on the engine on a motorcycle.

3. When rotating the phone to a specific position and then clicking on the screen, a laser sound is triggered, simulating pulling the trigger on a laser gun. Given that we can specify within what range of x,y,z coordinates a shot should be able to be fired, we can basically choose different skill levels and develop it further into an interactive game. If we would set the coordinate intervals to small enough ranges, the laser gun would only fire if you have it pointed to an exact position. Perhaps changing it so that it always make a shooting sound, but make a hit sound if the user points it exactly right.
